## Overview

<a href="https://josephmudd.dev">**josephmudd.dev**</a> is my personal portfolio website.

The site, adapted from an <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> theme, provides a clean, professional, and accessible space for potential employers and collaborators to contact me and view my projects and experience.

## Key Features

- **Project Showcase:** Highlights my key projects with detailed descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and source code.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Accessible:** Designed with accessibility in mind, including proper color contrast, semantic HTML, and ARIA roles.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Astro, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics
- **Fonts and Styling:** Custom fonts and global CSS adjustments for a consistent and clean look

## Development Journey

The build of **josephmudd.dev** was a quick dip into the world of Astro and Tailwind that involved:

1. **Initial Setup:** Configuring the Astro framework and setting up the project structure using a template.
2. **Design and Implementation:** Modifying the already clean and modern design to better suit my vision.
3. **Feature Enhancements:** Adding features like analytics, favicons, and serverless functionality.
4. **Troubleshooting:** Addressing deployment issues on Vercel that required rolling back the Node.js version and resolving ensuing issues.

## Challenges

- **Astro Learning Curve:** While picking up Astro was relatively simple, there was still a slight learning curve to adapting the template to my needs, which I overcame by reading the documentation and critically analyzing other components for context.
- **Vercel Deployment Issues:** Vercel had issues that necessitated rolling back the Node.js version, causing a cascade of problems that I fixed using rigorous online research.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the site is accessible to all users, particularly in improving text contrast and using ARIA roles effectively.

## What I Learned

This project helped me to:

- Enhance my skills in creating accessible web content.
- Gain experience in deploying and managing a serverless website.
- Troubleshoot site hosting issues and, if necessary, roll back Node.js versions.
- Begin to work with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

## Future Improvements

With more time, I'll focus on adding the following enhancements:

- **Interactive Features:** Add more interactive elements to engage visitors.
- **SEO:** Further optimize the site, specifically for search engine visibility.
- **Content Expansion:** Continuously add new blog posts and project updates to keep the site fresh and informative.
