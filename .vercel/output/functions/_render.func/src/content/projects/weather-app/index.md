## Overview

**Weather App** is a web application designed to fetch and display current weather information for a specified city. This project was built to practice working with APIs and improve JavaScript skills.

The app offers a straightforward and clean interface, making it easy for users to search for weather information.

## Key Features

- **City Search:** Users can search for any city to get current weather data.
- **Temperature Conversion:** Offers temperature display in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Github Pages
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetches weather data from a third-party API

## Development Journey

Building the Weather App was an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into JavaScript and API interactions. The project started with setting up the basic HTML and CSS, followed by integrating JavaScript to handle API calls and data processing.

The development process involved:

1. Creating a search form to input city names.
2. Fetching weather data from a public API based on user input.
3. Processing and displaying the fetched data in a user-friendly manner.
4. Implementing temperature conversion and responsive design for better usability.

## Challenges

- **API Integration:** Understanding and handling API responses was initially challenging, especially managing asynchronous JavaScript and error handling.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Ensuring the UI dynamically updates with the correct data and maintaining a clean and intuitive layout was a significant task.

## What I Learned

This project helped me improve multiple skills:

- Working with APIs and handling asynchronous JavaScript.
- Processing and displaying data dynamically in the UI.
- Enhancing CSS skills to create a responsive design.
- Deploying a web application using Github Pages.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I'd focus on the following enhancements:

- **User Preferences:** Allow users to save their preferred cities and temperature units.
- **Improved Interface:** Enhance user interface to provide a clearer and more intuitive view of weather information to the user.

While there are still areas I could refine in the Weather App given more time, the project was an incredibly rewarding and insightful experience, particularly when implementing asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
