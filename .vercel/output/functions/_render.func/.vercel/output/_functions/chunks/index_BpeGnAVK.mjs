The primary objective was to practice and enhance my skills with this shiny new UI/UX Library.\n\nIt's a clean and minimal app that helps users build their resumes step-by-step, then generates a PDF they can download.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple, wizard-style setup that collects user information one section at a time.\n- **PDF Generation:** Uses <a href=\"https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF\" target=\"_blank\">jsPDF</a> to turn resume data into a downloadable PDF.\n- **Custom Inputs:** Input fields with labels that move out of the way when you type, keeping the design clean and accessible.\n- **Easy Navigation:** Buttons to jump back to previous sections for quick edits.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS\n- **Build Tool**: Vite\n- **Deployment**: Vercel\n- **PDF Library**: jsPDF\n\n## Development Journey\n\nBuilding Resume Wizard was tough but rewarding.\n\nI started with a basic, but full implementation, then ultimately decided to re-approach the project with the goal of better applying React principles as well as integrating a third-party PDF-generation library. I figured building the second iteration would give me plenty of opportunity to not only hone my new React skills, but also to drill-down on JavaScript fundamentals, third-party library usage, and Responsive-design techniques.\n\nThere was admittedly quite a bit more trial and error than I anticipated going into the second approach, but I'm certain that I'm a much stronger developer because of it.\n\n## Challenges\n\n- **PDF Generation:** Finding and using a PDF library was tricky because of my limited knowledge of the inner-workings of PDFs. I had to research a few different libraries before finding the one I felt was most optimal for this project.\n- **Interface Design:** Balancing the HTML structure with the logic of the application was difficult. Next time, I think allocating a bit more time to sketching out the design first will better streamline and speed-up the entire process altogether.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nThis project helped me to learn and improve multiple skills:\n\n- React state management and object destructuring\n- Creating custom hooks and avoiding prop-drilling\n- Using state effectively, working with nested components, and data mapping\n- Filtering objects and using ternary operators\n- Deploying a project through Vercel\n- Working with external JavaScript Libraries and reviewing documentation\n\n## Future Improvements\n\nIf I had more time, I'd refactor the code to be even more modular and reduce repetition. I feel that doing this on initial-write of a codebase is a skill that will improve greatly through deliberate practice, and the second approach on this project certainly propelled me in this regard.\n";
